Note on error messaging:

All error messages appear when the submit button is pressed, then disapear in read time. 

The conditional error message is on the email field:

1. Click the email field
2. Notice there is a message below the field saying something like "must have a value"
3. Start typing the email but stop before creating it is a valid email.
4. The error message below now says "must be a valid email".

Note: Google autofill options often get in the way of the error message. Right click out of the text field if this happens
to see that the error message is being displayed.

Note on updates from prior submissions:

If I select "JS Puns" and "Gold" and then change the design to "I <3 JS" the Color field continues to show "Gold" even though that color isn't available for "I <3 JS". The Color field should update to either show an option that is available for the newly selected Design or some type of placeholder like "Please select a color".

Should be fixed now^
